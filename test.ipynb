      "Dog Temporal range: Late Pleistocene to present[1] Conservation status Domesticated Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Dog (Redirected from Dogs ) The dog (Canis familiaris  or Canis lupus familia ris) is a domesticated  descenda nt of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct  population of Pleistocene wolves  over 14,000 years ago. The dog was the first species  to be domesticated by humans . Experts estimate that hunter -gatherers  domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of agriculture . Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch -rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids .[4] The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5] Dog breed s vary widely in shape, size, and color . They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting , herding , pulling loads, protection , assisting police  and the military , companionship , therapy , and aiding disabled people . Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior , and the human–canine bond  has been a topic of frequent study . This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet  of \"man's best friend \". In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus  published in his Systema Naturae , the two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature ). Canis  is the Latin  word meaning \"dog\",[7] and under this genus , he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal . He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris  and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis lupus .[2] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (cauda recurvata  in Latin  term), which is not found in any other canid .[8] In 1999, a study of mitochondrial DNA  (mtDNA) indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from the grey wolf, with the dingo  and New Guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other .[9] In the third edition of Mammal Species of the WorldTaxonomy12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 1/41Family: Canidae Genus: Canis Species: C. familiaris Binomial name Canis familiaris Linnaeus, 1758[2] Synonyms[3] List C. aegyptius  Linnaeus, 1758 C. alco  C.

Smith, 1839 C. fricator  Gmelin, 1792published in 2005, the mammalogist  W. Christ opher Wozencraft  listed under the wolf Canis lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies, which formed the domestic dog clade: familiaris , as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and dingo , named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included hallstr omi (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name (junior synonym ) for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mtDNA  study as one of the guides informing his decision.[3] Mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris  and dingo  together under the \"domestic dog\" clade[10] with some debating it.[11] In 2019, a workshop hosted by the IUCN /Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be feral Canis familiaris  and therefore did not assess them for the IUCN Red List  of Threatened Species.[12] The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel , Germany . Contextual , isotopic , genetic , and morphological  evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.[13] The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been spray ed with red hematite  powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper .[14] Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs , but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated[15] because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene .[1] This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated[16][17] in the time of hunter - gatherers ,[18] which predates agriculture.[1] DNA  sequences  show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any modern wolf lineage. Some studies have posited that all living wolves are more closely related to each other than to dogs,[19][18] while others have suggested that dogs are more closely related to modern Eurasian wolves than to American wolves.[20] The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal  pathway into domestication.[15][21] The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists and archaeologists for decades.[16] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 yearsEvolution Domestication12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 2/41C. fricatrix  Linnaeus, 1758 C. fuillus  Gmelin, 1792 C. gallicus  Gmelin, 1792 C. glaucus  C.

The skull, body , and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores . These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology , which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and colour .[17] Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, hunting,[17] retrieving , and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior , boldness, and aggression.[17] Present-day dogs are dispersed around the world.[22] An examp le of this dispersal is the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.[18]Breeds12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 3/41C. obesus  Gmelin, 1792 C. orientalis  Gmelin, 1792 C. pacificus  C.

Dogs use their carnassial teeth  to cut food into bite-sized chunks, more especially meat.[31] Dogs' senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and magnetoreception . One study suggests that dogs can feel small variations in Earth's magnetic field.[32] Dogs prefer to defecate with their spines aligned in a north-south position in calm magnetic field  conditions.[33] Dogs' vision is dichromatic ; the dog's  visual world consists of yellows, blues, and grays. They have difficulty differentiating between red and green. The diver gence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12–25°, depending on the breed. Dogs' eyes of different breeds  can have different retina configurations. The fovea centralis area of dogs' eyes, which is attached to a nerve fiber, is the most sensitive to photons .[34] The coats  of domes tic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.[35] Prematur e graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with impulsive behaviors , anxiety  behaviors , and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals.[36] Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat. The coats of certain breeds are often groomed to a characteristic style, for example, the Yorkshire terrier 's \"show cut\".[31]Senses Coat Dewclaw12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 5/41Location of a dog's carnassials; the inside of the 4th upper premolar aligns with the outside of the 1st lower molar, working like scissor blades.A dog's dewclaw  is the five digits  in its forelimb and hind legs.  Dewclaws on the forelimbs  are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached  only by skin. Most  dogs aren't born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs. Dogs' dewclaws consist of the proximal phalanges and distal phalanges . Some publications thought that dewc laws in wolves, who usually do not have dewclaws, were a sign of hybridization with dogs.[37][38] A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the vertebral column , which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 vertebrae  enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles. One of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state.[39] The tail also helps the dog maintain balance by putting its weight on the oppos ite side of the dog's tilt, and it can also help the dog spread its anal gland 's scent through the tail's position and movement.[40] Dogs can have a violet gland  (or supracaudal gland) characterized by sebaceous glands  on the dorsal surface of their tails; in some breeds, it may be vestigial or absent. The enlar gement of the violet gland in the tail, which can create a bald spot from hair loss, can be caused by Cushing's disease  or an excess of sebum from androgens  in the sebaceous glands.[41] A study suggests that dogs show asymmetric tail-wagging responses to different emotive stimuli. \"Stimuli that could be expected to elicit approach tendencies seem to be associated with [a] higher amplitude of tail-wagging movements to the right side\".[42][43] Dogs can injure themselves by wagging their tails forcefully; this condition is called kennel tail, happy tail, bleeding tail, or splitting tail.[44] In some hunting dogs , the tail is tradition ally docked  to avoid injuries. Some dogs can be born without tails because  of a DNA  variant in the T gene, which can also result in a congenitally short (bobtail) tail.[45] Tail docking is oppo sed by many veterinary and animal welfare organistions such as the American Veterinary  Medical Association[46] and the British Veterinary Association .[47] Evidence from veterinary practices and questionnaires  showed that around 500 dogs would need to have their tail docked to prevent one injury .[48] Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow  and hip dysplasia , blindness , deafness , pulmonic stenosis , a cleft palat e, and trick knees . Two severe medic al conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra , affecting unspayed  females of all breeds and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus  (bloat), which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly . Dogs are also susceptible to parasitesTail Health12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 6/41A lateral view of a dog skeleton A black Standard Schnauzer with a docked tailsuch as fleas , ticks , mites , hookworms , tapeworms , roundworms , and heartworms  that can live in their hearts.[49] In addition, they may suffer from canine distemper virus (CDV). This morbillivirus  can infect caniforms  and feliforms , such as canines, felines, and bears. As the dog population grows, cases of CDV in wildlife will spread accordingly .[50] Rabies  is another pathogen dogs may catch, particularly those who have not been sanitized or given vaccines.[51] Several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, includ ing chocolate  solids, causing theobromine poison ing, onions  and garlic , causing thiosulfate , sulfoxide , or disulfide  poisoning , grapes  and raisins , macadamia nuts, and xylitol .[52] The nicotine  in tobacco can also be dangerous to dogs. Signs of ingestion can include copious vomiting (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea . The symptoms of hydrocarbon mixture  indigestion can be abdominal pain, aspiration pneumonia , oral ulcers , vomiting, or death.[53][54] The most common deaths among dogs were neoplasia  and heart disease , followed by toxicosis  and gastrointestinal disease .[55][56][57] A 20-year -record study found that respiratory disease  was the most common cause of death in Bulldogs .[58] Puppies were more likely to die from infection  or congenital disease .[59] Dogs can also have some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes , dental  and heart disease , epilepsy , cancer , hypothyroidism , and arthritis . Type 1 diabetes mellitus , resembling human diabetes, is the type of diabetes seen most often  in dogs.[60] Their pathology  is similar to that of humans, as is their response  to treatment and their outcomes. The genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders  led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways .[22] Dogs regulate their body temperature through evaporation of saliva  and lung moisture by panting.[61] Dogs are a source of zoonotic infections  and are known to transmit several diseases to humans by infected saliva, aerosols , feces, and direct contact.[62] Pets,  including dogs, can catch COVID-19 . As with humans, infected pets may exhibit a variety of symptoms or no symptoms at all.[63] The typical lifespan of dogs varies wide ly among breeds, but the median  longevity (the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive) is approximately 12.7 years.[64][65] Obesity correlates negatively with longevity with one study finding obese dogs have a life expectancy approximately a year and a half less than dogs with a healthy weight.[64]Lifespan Reproduction12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 7/41Two dogs tied after matingIn domest ic dogs, sexual maturity  happens around six months to one year for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle , characterized by their vulvas  swelling and producing dischar ges, usually lasting between 4 and 20 days.[66] They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually , during which the body prepares for pregnancy . At the peak of the cycle, females will become estrous, mentally and physically receptive to copulation . Because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter.[5] Fertilizati on typically occurs two to five days after ovulation. After ejaculation , the dogs are coitally tied for around 5–30 minutes because of the male's bulbus glandis swelling and the female's constrictor vestibuli contracting; the male will continue ejaculating until they untie naturally due to muscle relaxation .[67] 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus , and after seven to eight more  days, a heartbeat is detectable.[68][69] Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization ,[5][70] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation  can vary . An average litter consists of about six puppies .[71] Neutering  is the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles  or the female's ovaries  and uterus , to elimin ate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs' overpopulation  in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal s (ASPCA) , advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized.[72] According  to the Humane Society of the United States , three to four millio n dogs and cats are euthanized  each year.[73] Many more are confined to cages in shelters. Spaying or castrating dogs is considered a major factor in keeping overpopulation down.[74] Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality , especially in male  dogs.[75] Spay ed female dogs are less likely to develop cancers  affecting the mammary glands , ovaries , and other  reproductive organs.[76] How ever, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence  in female  dogs,[77] prostate cancer  in males,[78] and osteosarcoma , hemangiosarcoma , cruciate ligament rupture , pyometra , obesity , and diabetes mellitus  in either sex.[79] A common  breeding  practice for pet dogs is to mate them  between close relatives  (e.g., between half- and full-siblings).[80] Inbreeding depressio n is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutati ons.[81] Outcrossi ng between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny .[82] In a study of seven dog breeds (the Bernese Mountain Dog, Basset Hound, Cairn Terrier, Brittany , German Shepherd Dog, Leonber ger, and West Highland White Terrier ), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.[83] Another analysis of data on 42,855 Dachshund  litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient  increased , litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increase d, thus indicating inbreeding depression.[84] In a study  ofNeutering Inbreeding depression12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 8/41Boxer  litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.[85] Dog behavior is the internally coordinat ed responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli .[86] Dogs' minds have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. They have acqu ired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.[87] Behavioral scientists thought that a set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes , are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.[88] Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.[89][90] In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed gene s showed variation between wolves and dogs.[91] These gene variati ons were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolu tion and indicate selection on both morphology and beha vior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis  pathway , with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or -flight response[90][92] (i.e., selection for tameness ) and emotional processing.[90] Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves, though some of these genes have been associated with aggression in certain dog breeds.[93][90] Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome  in humans, which cause hypersociability  at the expense of problem-solving ability .[94] In a 2023 study of 58 dogs, some dogs classified as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -like show ed lower serotonin  and dopamine  conc entrations.[95] A similar  study claims that hyperactivity is more common in male and young dogs.[96] A dog can become aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety , territor ial protection, or protecting an item it considers valuable.[97] Acute stress reactions  from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seen in dogs can evolve into chronic stress .[98] Police dogs with PTSD can often refuse to work.[99] Dogs have  a natural instinct called prey drive  (the term is chiefly  used to describe training dogs' habits) which can be influenced by breeding. These instincts can drive dogs to consider objects or other animals to be prey or drive possessiv e behavior . These traits have been enhanced in some breeds so that they may be used to hunt and kill vermin  or other pests.[100] Pupp ies or dogs sometimes bury food under ground. One study found that wolves outperformed dogs in finding food caches, likely due to a \"difference  in motivation\" between wolves and dogs.[101] Some puppies and dogs engage in coprophagy  out of habit, stress,  for attention, or boredom; most of them will not do it later in life. A study hypothesizes that the behavior was inherited from wolves, a behavior likely evolved to lessen the presence of intestinal parasites  in dens.[102] Most dogs  can swim. In a study of 412 dogs, around 36.5% of the dogs could not swim; the other 63.5% were able to swim without a trainer in a swimming pool.[103] A study of 55 dogs found a correlation between swimming and 'improvement' of the hip osteoarthritis joint .[104]Behavior Nursing12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 9/41Dog swimming over to catch a ball A female dog is nursing her newborn puppies. Dog soundsThe female dog may produce colostrum  1–7 days before giving birth, lasting for around three months.[105][106] Colostrum  peak production was around 3 weeks postpartum and increased with litter size.[106] The dog can sometimes vomit and refuse food during child contractions .[107] In the later stages of the dog's pregnancy , nesting behaviour  may occur .[108] Puppies are born with a protective fetal mem brane that the mother usually removes shortly after birth. Dogs can have the maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies' feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their hormonal state.[109][110] While male-parent dogs can show more disinterested behaviour toward their own puppies,[111] most can play with the young pups as they would with other dogs or humans.[112] A female dog may abandon or attack her puppies or her male partner dog if she is stressed or in pain.[113] Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference . A study with Rico , a Border Collie , showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after four weeks of the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser , documented that he had learned the names and could associate them by verbal command with over 1,000 words.[114] One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are similar to those of horses , chimpanzees , or cats.[115] One study of 18 household dogs found that the dogs could not distinguish food bowls at specific locations without distinguishing cues; the study stated that this indicates a lack of spatial memory .[116] A study stated that dogs have a visual sense for number . The dogs showed a ratio-dependent activation  both for numerical values from 1–3 to lar ger than four .[117] Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind  by engaging in deception.[118] Another experimental study showed evidence that Australian dingos  can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.[119] Another study show ed that after under going training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at humans, while socialized wolves do not.[120] 0:30 Intelligence Communication12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 10/41A dog making noises and barking Problems playing this file? See media help.Dog comm unication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans, and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.[121] Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facia l expressi on,[122][123] voca lization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, phero mones, and taste). Dogs mark their territories  by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment.[124][125] Both sexes of dogs may also urinate to communicate anxiety or frustration, submissiveness, or when in exciting or relaxing situations.[126] Aroused dogs can be a result of the dogs' higher cortisol levels.[127] Between 3 and 8 weeks of age, dogs tend to focus on other dogs for social interaction, and between 5 and 12 weeks of age, they shift their focus to people.[128] Belly exposure in dogs can be a defensive behavior that can lead to a bite or to seek comfort.[129] Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body  posture. With their acute sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to various cues, including the distinctive barking  patterns that convey different messages. A study using functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMR I) has shown that dogs respond to both vocal and nonvocal voices using the brain's region towards the temporal pole, similar to that of humans' brains. Most dogs also looked significantly longer at the face whose expression matched the valence of vocalization .[130][131][132] A study of caudate responses  shows that dogs tend to respond more positively to social rewards than to food rewards.[133] The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran  living in the human environment.[134][135] In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million[136] and 987 million.[137] About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries .[138] In the developing world , it is estimated that three- quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village , or community dogs.[139] Most of these dogs live as scavengers  and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing that village dogs' most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (1 1%).[140] Feral and free-ranging dogs ' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans.[134] Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage when facing large dog groups.[141][142] In some insta nces, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.[143] Although the numb ers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.[141]0:15 Ecology Population Competitors12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 11/41A golden retriever gnawing on a pig's foot boneCoyotes  and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular , leopards  are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter their size.[144] Siberian tigers  in the Amur River  region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. Amur tigers will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way .[145] Striped hyenas  are known to kill dogs in their range.[146] Dogs as introduced predator mammals have affected the ecology of New Zealand , which lacked indigenous land-based mammals before human settlement.[147] Dogs have  made 11 vertebrate  species extinct and are identified as a 'potential threat' to at least 188 threatened  species worldwide;[148] another figure is that dogs have  also been linked to the extinction of 156 animal species.[149] Dogs have been documented to have killed a few birds of the endangered species, the kagu , in New Caledonia .[150] Dogs are typically described as omnivores .[5][151][152] Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase  and other  genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starc h-rich diet.[4] Simi lar to humans,  some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva  and are classified as having a high-starch  diet.[153] However , more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produc e bile acid with taurine , and they cannot produce vitamin D , which they obtain from animal flesh. Of the twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms  (including selenocysteine ), dogs cannot synthesize ten: arginine , histidine , isoleucine , leucine , lysine , methionine , phenylalanine , threonine , tryptophan , and valine .[154][155][156] Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance . These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.[157] As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog has notable exceptions of presence in: The Aboriginal Tasmanians , who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos  on that continent The Andamanese peoples , who were isolated when rising sea levels  covered the land bridge  to Myanmar The Fuegians , who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog , an already extinct dif ferent canid species Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs or where the dogs died out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands ,[158] Palau[159] and most of the Caroline Islands  with exceptions such as Fais Island  and Nukuoro ,[160] the Marshall Islands ,[161] the Gilbert Islands ,[161] New Caledonia ,[162] Vanuatu ,[162][163] Tonga ,[163] Marquesas ,[163] Mangaia  in the Cook Islands , Rapa Iti  in FrenchDiet Range12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 12/41Polynesia , Easter Island ,[163] the Chatham Islands ,[164] and Pitcairn Island  (settled by the Bounty  mutineers , who killed of f their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships).[165] Dogs were introduced to Antarctica  as sled dogs . Starting practice in December 1993, dogs were later outlawed by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty international agreement  due to the possible risk of spreading infections.[166] Dogs shall not be introduced onto land, ice shelves or sea ice. — Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty , signed in 1991 in Madrid, amended version of Annex II, Article 4 (number two) The domesticated dog apparentl y originat ed as a predator  and scavenger .[167][168] Domestic  dogs inherited complex beha viors, such as bite inhibi tion, from their wolf ancestors,  which would have been pack hunte rs with complex body langu age. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for dogs' trainability , playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations,[169] and probably also their co-existence with early human hunter -gatherers.[170][171] Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting , herding , pulling loads, protection , assisting police  and the military , companionship , and aiding disabled individuals . These roles in human society have earned them the nickname \"man's best friend \" in the Western world. In some cultures, however , dogs are also a source of meat .[172][173] The keeping of dogs  as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history .[174] Pet-dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.[174] In the 1980s, there  have been changes in the pet dog's functions, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support  of their human guardians.[175][176][177] Within the second half of the 20th century , the first dogs' social status major shift has been \"commodification\" , allowing it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior .[177] The secon d has been the broadening of the concepts of family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[177] A vast range of commodity forms aim to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[178] The list of goods and services available for dogs, such as dog- training books, classes, and television programs, has increased.[179][178] The majority of contemporary dog-ow ners describe their pet as part of the family , although some state that it is an ambiva lent relationship.[177] Some dog-trainers have promoted a dominance model  of dog-hu man relationships. However , theRoles with humans Pets12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 13/41A Siberian husky with a human companionidea of the \"alpha dog\"  trying to be dominant is based on a controversial theory about wolf packs.[180][181] It has been disputed that \"trying to achieve status\"  is characteristic of dog-human interac tions.[182] Hum an family members have increased participation in activities in which the dog is an integral partner , such as dog dancing  and dog yoga .[178] According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association  in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–201 0, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs.[183] The sourc e shows that nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% own two dogs, and nearly 9% own more than two dogs. The data also shows an equal number of male and female pet dogs; less than one- fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters .[184] In addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs such as collies  and sheepdogs  have  been bred for herding livestock ; for huntin g; for rodent control (such as terriers); as search and rescue dogs ;[185] as detection dogs (such as those trained to detect illicit drugs or chemical weapons );[186][187] as homeguard dogs; as police dogs (\"K-9\"); as welfare-purpose dogs; as dogs who assist fishermen retrieve their nets; and as dogs that pull loads (such as sled dogs ).[5] In 1957, the dog Laika  became one of the first animals to be launched into Earth orbit  aboard the Soviets 's Sputnik 2 ; she provided evidence that mammals could survive in space, but died during the flight from overheating .[188][189] Various kinds of service dogs and assist ance dogs, including guide dogs , hearing dogs , mobility assistance dogs , and psychiatric service dogs , assist individuals with disabilities.[190][191] A study of 29 dogs found that 9 dogs owned by people with epilepsy were reported to exhibit attention-getting behavior to their handler 30 seconds to 45 minutes prior to an impending seizure; there was no significant correlation between the patients' demographics, health, or attitude towards their pets.[192] There are breed-conformation shows and dog sports  (including racing , sledding , and agility competitions ) for dogs to particip ate in with their guardians. In dog shows, also referred to as \"breed shows\", a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as descri bed in a breed standard .[193] Weight pulling , a dog sport involvi ng pulling weight, has been criticized for promoting doping  and for its risk of injury .[194]Workers Shows and sports Dogs as food12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 14/41Meat from  dogs is consumed in some  East Asian  countries , includin g China ,[172] Vietnam ,[173] Korea ,[195] Indonesia ,[196] and the Philippines ;[197] such traditions date back to antiquity .[198] It is estim ated that 30 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every  year. Han Chinese traditionally ate dog meat.[199] Chin a is the world' s largest consumer of dogs, with an estimated 10 to 20 million dogs killed every year for human consumption—a figure derived from extrapolating  industry reports on meat tonnage.[200] Switzerland , Polynesia , and pre-Columbian Mexico  historically consumed dog meat.[201][202][203] In some parts of Poland[204][205] and Central Asia,[206][207] dog fat is reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs.[208] Eating dog meat is a social taboo  in most parts of the world; debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat.[209] Emperors of the Sui dynasty (581–618) in China attempted to outlaw  dog-meat consumption, with the Tang dynasty  (618–907) partially prohibiting dog meat consumption at events.[210] Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is Western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat.[211][212][213][214] In some countries, selling or slaughtering dogs for human consumption is prohibited , though some still consume it in modern times .[215][216] The most popular Korean dog dish, bosintang , a spicy stew, aims to balance the body's heat during the summer months. Some followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi, or the body's 'vital ener gy'. Dogs are not as widely consumed as beef, pork, and chicken.[217] The prima ry dog breed raised for meat in South Korea is the Nureongi , which is a breed that has not been recognized by international bodies.[218] In 2018, the South Korean gover nment  passed a bill bannin g restaurants that sell dog meat from doing so during that year's Winter Olympics .[219] On 9 January 2024 , the South Korean parliament  passed a law banning the distribution and sale of dog meat, to take ef fect in 2027.[220] In 2018, the World Health Organization  (WHO) reported that 59,000 people died globally from rabies , with 59.6% of the deaths in Asia and 36.4% in Africa. Rabies is a disease for which dogs are the most significant vector .[221] Dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. Children in mid-to-late childhood are the largest group bitten by dogs, with a greater risk of injury to the head and neck. They are more likely to need medical treatment and have the highest death-rate.[222] Sharp claws can lacerate flesh, which can lead to serious infections.[223] In the United States , cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year.[224] It has been estima ted that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in U.K.  hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study concluded that dog-associated road accidents  involving injuries more commonly involve two-wheeled vehicles .[225]In Korea Health risks12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 15/41Walking a dogToxocara canis  (dog roundworm ) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis . In the United States, about 10,000 cases of Toxocara  infec tion are repor ted in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected.[226] Untreated  toxocaria sis can cause retinal  damage and decreased vision.[227] Dog feces can also contain hookworms  that cause cutaneous larva migrans  in humans.[228][229] The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical and psychological well-being.[230] Studies suggest that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being, but they have been critic ized for being \"poorly controlled\".[231][232] One study states that \"the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports  but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal\".[233] Earlier studies have shown that pet-dog or -cat guardians make fewer hospital visits and are less likely to be on medication for heart problems and sleeping difficulties  than non-guardians.[233] People with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats or those without pets; these effects are relatively long-term.[234] Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased survival in cases of coronary artery disease . Human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarctio n than those  who do not own dogs.[235] Studies have found a small to moderate correlation between dog-ownership and increased adult physical-activity levels.[236] A 2005 paper states:[230] recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease , a reduced use of general practitioner  services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelli ng older people. Research has, however , pointed to significantly less absenteeism  from school through sickness among children who live with pets. Health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely  from having dogs as pets. For example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular , beha vioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety ,[237] and are exposed to immune-stimulating  microor ganisms, which can protect against aller gies and autoimmune diseases (according to the hygiene hypothesis ). Other benefits include dogs as social support.[238] One study indicated that wheelchair -users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[239] In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.[240] In one study , new guardians reported a significant reductio n in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, which was sustained through the 10-month study .[234]Health benefits12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 16/41Cerberus with the gluttons in Dante's third circle of hell, depicted by William BlakeUsing dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late-18th century , when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders .[241] Anim al-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase smiling and laughing among people with Alzheimer's disease .[242] One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders  who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, knowledge, and skill-objectives and decreased antisocial  and violent behavior  compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.[243] Artworks have depicted dogs as symbols  of guidance , protection , loyalty , fidelity , faithfulness , alertness , and love.[244] In ancient Mesopotamia , from the Old Babylonian period  until the Neo-Babylonian period, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina , the goddess of healing and medicine,[245] and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her.[245] In the Neo-Assyrian  and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs served as emblems of magical protection.[245] In China , Korea , and Japan , dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[246] In mytholo gy, dogs often appear as pets or as watchdogs.[246] Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-Eu ropean mythologies[247][248] and may originate  from Proto-Indo-European traditions .[247][248] In Greek mythology , Cerberus  is a three -headed, dragon -tailed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades .[246] Dogs also feature in association with the Greek goddess Hecate .[249] In Norse mythology , a dog called Garmr  guards Hel, a realm of the dead .[246] In Persian mythology , two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge .[246] In Welsh mythology , Cŵn Annwn  guards Annwn .[246] In Hindu mythology , Yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs named Shyama and Sharvara , which each have four eyes—they are said to watch over the gates of Naraka .[250] A black dog is considered to be the vahana  (vehicle) of Bhairava  (an incarnation of Shiva).[251] In Christianity , dogs represent faithfulness.[246] Within the Roman Catholic  denomination specifically , the iconography of Saint Dominic  includes a dog, after the saint's mother dreamt of a dog sprin ging from her womb and became pregnant shortly after that.[252] As such, the Dominican Order  (Ecclesiastical Latin : Domini canis) means \"dog of the Lord\" or \"hound of the Lord\".[252] In Christi an folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their churchyards  from sacrilege .[253] Jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets, but requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animalsCultural importance12/08/2024, 15:46 Dog - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog 17/41that they own) befor e themselves and to make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.[254][255] The view  on dogs in Islam  is mixed,  with some schools of thought viewing them as unclean,[246] although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition [...] falsely attributed to the Prophet\".[256] The Sunni Maliki school  jurists disagree with the idea that dogs are unclean.[257] Dog – the species (or subspecies) as a whole, also any male member of the same.[258] Bitch  – any female member of the species (or subspecies).[259] Puppy  or pup – a young member of the species (or subspecies) under 12 months old.[260] Sire – the male parent of a litter .[260] Dam  – the female parent of a litter .[260] Litter  – all of the puppies resulting from a single whelping.[260] Whelping  – the act of a bitch giving birth.[260] Whelps  – puppies still dependent upon their dam.[260] 1.

Of the twenty-one amino acids common to all life forms  (including selenocysteine ), dogs cannot synthesize ten: arginine , histidine , isoleucine , leucine , lysine , methionine , phenylalanine , threonine , tryptophan , and valine .[154][155][156] Like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain nitrogen balance . These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.[157] As a domesticated or\n",

The symptoms of hydrocarbon mixture  indigestion can be abdominal pain, aspiration pneumonia , oral ulcers , vomiting, or death.[53][54] The most common deaths among dogs were neoplasia  and heart disease , followed by toxicosis  and gastrointestinal disease .[55][56][57] A 20-year -record study found that respiratory disease  was the most common cause of death in Bulldogs .[58] Puppies were more likely to die from infection  or congenital disease .[59] Dogs can also have some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes , dental  and heart disease , epilepsy , cancer , hypothyroidism ,\n",
